            <h2>Creating Mobile Applications</h2>
            <p>Creating mobile applications is the process of designing, programming, and deploying apps for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Below are the basic steps to help you get started:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Choosing a platform:</strong>
                    <p>First, decide which platform you want to develop for. The most popular platforms are Android and iOS. You can also consider creating cross-platform applications.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Choosing a technology:</strong>
                    <p>Depending on the platform and project requirements, you can choose different technologies:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Android:</strong> Java, Kotlin</li>
                            <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Swift, Objective-C</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross-platform:</strong> Flutter, React Native</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Designing the user interface (UI):</strong>
                    <p>Create an intuitive and attractive user interface. Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD to design the app's appearance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Programming the application:</strong>
                    <p>Start implementing app features such as login, navigation, data handling, and API integration. Ensure the code is clean and well-organized.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Testing:</strong>
                    <p>Test the app on various devices and emulators to ensure it works correctly and is free of bugs.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Publishing:</strong>
                    <p>After testing, publish the app on Google Play (for Android) or the App Store (for iOS). Follow the publication guidelines for each platform.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
